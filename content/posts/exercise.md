## Description

Here's where I list what exercises that I am hoping to do to reach my fitness goals.


## Schedule

I am committing to go to the gym 3-5 days a week from Monday to Friday, ensuring I have one of each type of day per week at least.

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Chest & Triceps | Back & Biceps | Legs | Back & Biceps | Chest & Triceps |


## Types of exercises for the workout day types:

### Chest & Triceps:

Bench press
Military press
Decline bench press
Incline bench press
Free-weight bench press
Seated chest press machine
Tricep dips
Free-weight over-the-head tricep extensions
Tricep extensions with rope attachment
Tricep extensions with straight or curled bar with cables
Free-weight shoulder raises
Shoulder raise machine

### Back & Biceps


### Legs


## Calculating weight to lift:

After roughly a month or so (or I am feeling particularly good), I will have a max day where I go in just to see exactly how much I can lift that that point.

Once I have a good idea of what the most I can safely lift is, I then try to match the amount I lift to be roughly 75% of that. (i.e., if I can do a maximum of 100 lbs, I will try to work out with 75 lbs.)

## Sets & Reps

Usually for a given day, I will perform exercises from the lists above for the workout day type, and perform ~3 sets at 10 reps each. To mix things up, I generally try to not do the same workouts every time and especially not in the same order. If the last time I went I worked out a given muscle group, I will start with another.

### Other, special cases:

- Max day: Attempt to get a new baseline for how much I should be lifting.
- Until failure: Start with a highish amount, perform as many reps as I can before failure, and then remove only a little bit of weight, go to failure, etc.

## Usual workout day example:
