## Description
I am trying to out a new diet. Per day, I am trying to stay roughly in the range of 1200-1400 calories.

## Here is the breakdown of what I have been eating:

- 10 am - Huel (2 scoops) 400 Cal
- 2 pm - Huel (2 scoops) 400 Cal OR A small meal (trying to stay in the ~400 Cal range)
- 3-6 pm - Snack (Usually ~100 calories)
- 7:30 pm - ~4 cups of Broccoli and small portion of lean meat (either fish or chicken) ~200-400 calories
- 10 pm - Another snack (Usually ~100 calories)

## Supplements:

- Fiber Well Gummies (2x for 5g diety fiber)

## If I breakdown and have things I shouldn't, the things I eat are:

- Frozen wheaties in lactaid milk
- Sourdough bread and Italian salad dressing
