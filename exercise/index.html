<p>Here&rsquo;s where I list what exercises that I am hoping to do to reach my fitness goals.</p>
<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>I am committing to go to the gym 3-5 days a week from Monday to Friday, ensuring I have one of each type of day per week at least.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-weight-to-lift">Calculating weight to lift:</h2>
<p>After roughly a month or so (or I am feeling particularly good), I will have a max day where I go in just to see exactly how much I can lift that that point.</p>
<p>Once I have a good idea of what the most I can safely lift is, I then try to match the amount I lift to be roughly 75% of that. (i.e., if I can do a maximum of 100 lbs, I will try to work out with 75 lbs.)</p>
<h2 id="sets--reps">Sets &amp; Reps</h2>
<p>Usually for a given day, I will perform exercises from the lists above for the workout day type, and perform ~3 sets at 10 reps each. To mix things up, I generally try to not do the same workouts every time and especially not in the same order. If the last time I went I worked out a given muscle group, I will start with another.</p>
<h3 id="other-special-cases">Other, special cases:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max day: Attempt to get a new baseline for how much I should be lifting.</li>
<li>Until failure: Start with a highish amount, perform as many reps as I can before failure, and then remove only a little bit of weight, go to failure, etc.</li>
</ul>
